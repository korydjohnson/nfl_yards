## Running Formations

We are only given offensive line-up (specifically for running plays) and offense personnel. Unfortunately, this doesn't contain nearly enough information as we would really like to predict which play they are running.

## Running Plays

## Defensive Formations

We are given defenders in the box and defensive personenel (how many of each position etc), not formation, but formation seems like it'd be far more informative. I actually don't know if there's "formation" left over after these two pieces of information.

## Defensive "Plays"
