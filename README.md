# Topic

This repository is for the Kaggle competition to predict NFL rushing yards.

The README is focused on folder organization and notes to keep things in order. General guidelines/suggestions:

1. Folders for separate model groups/coding styles/tasks. Within each folder there is an info.md file. If there are many files, describing each briefly here would help minimize confusion.
2. Please add a description to this README of what the folder contains (insofar as it isn't evident from the title).
3. We should keep a running description of the current state of the project (which folders contain the most recent/best work, which are old and can be ignored etc). Please include a date.
4. Final code that should be used elsewhere (ie no longer in development) should be separated and placed in the scripts folder to be sourced via ../scripts/fileName (R) or ..scripts.fileName (Python, I think).
